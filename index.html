                <p class="text-muted text-left">We believe that education is not just all about having a great classroom with amazing tutors and brilliant text books that can aide a child in scoring great results. But it is the personality in which they develop over the course of years through various interactive activities that helps in strengthening onesâ€™ character.


Over here, we have a standard playground big enough to accommodate a cricket team or play kabbadi and volleyball. A library that houses plenty of books have been segregated and digitalised as well, accordingly to each section wise and curriculum. A well-equipped computer lab with trained faculties from NIIT is present to train and clear any doubts patiently. The high-tech auditorium here at RNS can house a capacity of 1000 and includes a world class projector, sound system and extensive lighting.


There is also a fully fledged transport system with 6 buses that comes with skilled and experienced drivers and tolerant helpers to help toddlers get in and get out the bus as well as help them get across the street safely. Furthermore, we give training to all the pupils enrolled at RNS in yoga, karate, handwriting, Vedic maths and drawing. It is important to us in that we see the child grow and evolve in all aspects in life.


With the state of the art classrooms, well edited text books from highly versed reknown authors and play grounds and libraries that is bound to help in the growth of a child, both in personality and in physicality, we make sure that each student enrolled here with us gets the equal exposure to cope up with any hardships they might need to face with the outside world.


Admissions are open to all students alike during the general month of the admission process.
